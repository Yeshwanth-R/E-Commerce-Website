## Authentication

This project integrates **NextAuth.js** for authentication, supporting both Google and GitHub OAuth providers. The following environment variables are required:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
```

For more detailed configuration, refer to [NextAuth.js documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction).

## Payment Integration

The checkout process is powered by **Stripe**, enabling secure payments for customers. Ensure that your environment includes the Stripe secret key:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
```

## For more on configuring Stripe, [visit Stripe API documentation.](https://docs.stripe.com/api)

## Image Storage

Product images and other media files are stored in Amazon AWS S3. This ensures secure and scalable storage. The following environment variables are needed to configure AWS S3:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
```

Make sure to set up your AWS S3 bucket and provide the correct environment variables.
